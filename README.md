Abstract :

Instant noodles are a favorite among many students. Besides being affordable, they are also convenient. However, consuming instant noodles can have negative health impacts due to their minimal nutritional content. To minimize this, it is necessary to modify instant noodle recipes to meet nutritional needs. This study aims to develop a system that uses a Greedy Algorithm to select healthier instant noodle recipe modifications based on the ingredients available to the user. The greedy algorithm was chosen for its efficiency in quickly generating good solutions. This system works by
identifying the user's ingredients and then finding modified instant noodle recipes that maximize the use of these ingredients while optimizing nutritional value.
